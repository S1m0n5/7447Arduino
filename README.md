This is a 7 segments display and in electronic usually is driven by a type of IC called decoder that converts BCD (Binary-Coded Decimal) into 7 segments. I have created this code for help to drive this IC with Arduino.

If you use my code at default, there are the connection to do, in this case we use Common Anode display (with 7447). In case of Common Cathode use 7448. All the datasheets are in the ![schematics and ds](https://github.com/S1m0n5/7447Arduino/tree/master/schematics%20and%20ds) directory.
